# Changelog

Notable changes to the skills in this repository. Each skill also carries its own version in
its `SKILL.md` frontmatter. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Contribution guide, issue forms, pull request template, and a CLA check for first-time
  contributors.
- `.github/scripts/check_skills.py`: a CI check for the rules a script can check.
- `screenshot-overlays`: aligns two screenshots of one screen and merges the hover tooltip or
  popover of one into the other, cut along its own border.
- `blockkit-forge`: Block Kit messages a bot builds from data it did not write: safe text from other
  systems, a dry-post as the bot that fails closed, scannable cards, tags added by an edit, live
  cards and thread timelines, the live enums from `blocks.validate`, and an example card.
- `screenshot-callouts`: arrows, boxes, numbered steps, callouts, highlights and solid redactions
  on a screenshot from a JSON spec, with measured targets, collision-free label placement, a
  rough.js sketch style, Excalidraw export and a read-back proof of every written file.

### Changed

- `excalidraw` 1.2.0: lint rules for arrows that cross, overlap or run through another arrow's
  label, ranked by the evidence (Purchase 1997: crossings hurt reading most). C4 element types,
  technologies and per-edge source provenance in the spec, with matching lint notes.
  `exfidelity.py` proves every label and edge of a Mermaid flowchart survives into the drawing.
  Repeated arrows between two boxes get their own lanes. Ids are now hashed from the parsed spec,
  so every existing diagram gets new ids and seeds once on its next build.
